Like a struggle against an invisible force. Each morning, I’d wake up surrounded by murky water, bits of plastic and strange, oily patches floating on the surface.
My feathers would feel weighed down by the grime clinging to them, and no matter how much I tried to preen, I couldn’t make them as clean and light as they once were.
Swimming through the water would feel uncomfortable, the smell sharp and unnatural, a reminder of the things humans had left behind.

As I pecked along the shore, looking for food, I’d find fewer and fewer plants, many of them coated with chemicals that tasted bitter and wrong.
Sometimes, I’d accidentally swallow a piece of plastic, mistaking it for a fish or bug, and feel a deep ache in my stomach that wouldn’t go away.
Flying would no longer be the joy it once was; with my feathers heavy and my body weakened, I’d find myself staying grounded more often, watching other birds with envy as they flew away to cleaner, safer places.

Socializing with other ducks would be tinged with worry; we’d all feel the effects of the pollution, and our gatherings would often end in silence, each of us sensing the same struggle.
At night, I’d settle down in the reeds, but the quiet comfort of nature would be replaced by a sense of dread, the once-lively pond now a shadow of its former self.
Living as a duck in a polluted world, I would feel the weight of each day, longing for a life where I could float freely in clean, fresh water again.
